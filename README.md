# Res-Q Disaster Relief Platform

Res-Q is an AI-powered disaster response and relief platform designed to streamline crisis management.
It enables users to report disasters, request resources, connect with donors, and access AI-based risk predictions and a first-aid chatbot.
By centralizing reporting, resource allocation, and risk analysis, Res-Q improves coordination and response efficiency during emergencies.

## Machine Learning Models (Random Forest)

The platform uses **Random Forest Classifier models** for:

1. Flood Risk Prediction
2. Storm Risk Prediction
3. Weather Risk Prediction
4. Earthquake Risk Prediction
5. Wildfire Risk Prediction

### Data Used for ML Predictions

#### 1. OpenWeatherMap API

Used for Weather, Flood, Storm, and Wildfire predictions.
Data fetched:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind Speed
* Rainfall (precipitation)
* Pressure
* Temperature Difference
* Soil Moisture (approximated where necessary)
* Vegetation-related weather factors
* Drought index estimation (derived)

#### 2. USGS Earthquake API

Used for Earthquake prediction.
Data fetched:

* Magnitude
* Depth
* Event Coordinates
* Distance from user location
* Population density (derived from coordinates)

#### 3. NASA FIRMS API

Used for Wildfire prediction.
Data fetched:

* Active fire locations
* Fire radiative power
* Brightness temperature
* Vegetation index estimation
* Fire confidence score

#### 4. Groq API

Used for chatbot responses and first-aid guidance.

All models are trained on synthetic datasets built using domain-based rules and API-derived parameters, ensuring prediction availability even when API data is limited.
